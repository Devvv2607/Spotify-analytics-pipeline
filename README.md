# Spotify Analysis Notebook\n\nThis workspace contains a Jupyter notebook `spotify_analysis.ipynb` that loads, cleans, and performs EDA on `spotify_clean.csv`.
\nUsage:\n1. Place `spotify_clean.csv` in this folder (or update the path in the notebook).\n2. Create and activate a Python environment (recommended).\n3. Install dependencies:\n\n```powershell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
\n4. Start Jupyter and open the notebook:\n\n```powershell
jupyter notebook
```
\n5. Run the final cell: `df_final = run_analysis('spotify_clean.csv')`\n\nThe notebook is modular and suitable for converting into a script or pipeline. If you want, I can also convert it into a `.py` script or run the notebook here to validate outputs.
